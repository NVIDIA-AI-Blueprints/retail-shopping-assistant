"""Comparing a value against the values the catalog advertises.

Every question here is answered against a closed set: the taxonomy the catalog
publishes. Is `dresses` the same entry as `dress`, is `crossbody_bags` the same
as `crossbody bag`, is `bag` a value the catalog advertises at all. Casing,
punctuation and plurals differ between what a model emits and what the catalog
stores, so the two are normalised before being compared.

This is not matching against shopper language and must not become that. It
never reads the shopper's sentence; it is handed one value and one catalog and
answers whether the value is in it. Guessing what a shopper meant is the
resolver's job, and the one place that still guesses with string operations is
`lexical_provenance.py`, which is on its way out.
