  - "For a light summer outfit, I would recommend pairing the 'Floral Camisole in White' with a light skirt. The white color and floral pattern on the camisole evoke a sense of airy freshness, perfect for warm weather. The adjustable straps and comfortable fit of the camisole ensure that it will be suitable for various body types and activities. 
To go with it, we have the Satin Effect Midi Skirt in Black and the Satin Effect Midi Skirt in Blush Pink. Both skirts are made from 100% RCS-certified recycled polyester, feature an elastic waistband for a comfortable fit, and have a timeless midi length that can be dressed up or down. 
If you’d like a more chic look, the black strappy sandals will complete the outfit.  Or if you’re going for comfort, I’d recommend either the Bow Trim Heeled Shoes in White or our Ballet Flats.
