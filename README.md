## Overview

The Retail Shopping Assistant is an AI-powered blueprint that provides a comprehensive interface for an intelligent retail shopping advisor. The chain server uses the Deep Agents SDK as the assistant harness over deterministic shopping tools, with SSE-framed responses, image-based search, optional VLM media perception, and intelligent shopping cart management.

### Key Features

- 🤖 **Intelligent Product Search**: The assistant translates natural language
  into catalog queries and advertised filters; the catalog performs only
  deterministic embedding retrieval and ranking
- 🛒 **Smart Cart Management**: Add, remove, and manage shopping cart items
- 🖼️ **Visual Search**: Upload images to find similar products
- 🎥 **Optional VLM Media Perception**: Enable a VLM role to analyze image and video uploads in shopping context
- 💬 **Conversational AI**: Natural language interactions
- 🔒 **Configurable Content Safety**: Built-in moderation and safety checks are on by default and can be disabled per request or config
- ⚡ **SSE Response Stream**: Event-stream response framing for chat clients; token-level Deep Agents streaming is a follow-up after the harness migration
- 📊 **Inference Visibility**: Model names, call counts, and token usage surfaced in the shopping UI
- 📱 **Responsive UI**: Modern, mobile-friendly interface

### Architecture

![Shopping Assistant Diagram](notebook/shopping-assistant-diagram.jpg)

The application follows a microservices architecture:
- **Chain Server**: Deep Agents SDK orchestration with one semantic query, a
  required capability-derived taxonomy envelope, deterministic constraint
  mapping, and same-scope search deduplication
- **Catalog Retriever**: Generative-LLM-free text/image embedding search, hard
  filtering, and deterministic result ranking
- **Memory Retriever**: User context and cart management
- **Guardrails**: Content safety and moderation
- **UI**: React-based frontend interface

For detailed architecture information, see the [Documentation Hub](docs/README.md).

### Catalog lifecycle and capability publishing

1. At startup, the catalog service loads `enriched_products.jsonl` and its
   field-role sidecar into one validated snapshot.
2. That snapshot supplies embedding documents, product details, filters, and
   the live contract at `http://localhost:8010/capabilities`.
3. On its first successful fetch, the chain server caches one process-wide
   contract shared by all sessions. Its aggregate endpoint at
   `http://localhost:8009/capabilities` returns the cached catalog contract with
   the other runtime capabilities.
4. The cached taxonomy values generate the agent's search-tool schema. Each
   search supplies one semantic query, a taxonomy scope, and non-taxonomy
   must-haves; deterministic chain code maps and validates them before calling
   the catalog.
5. The catalog validates the request again, generates embeddings, applies hard
   filters, and ranks results. It performs no shopper-language interpretation or
   chat/completion call.

Catalog values are never copied into agent or catalog code. After replacing the
JSONL or sidecar, restart and verify the catalog service first, then restart and
verify the chain server so its process-lifetime cache matches the new snapshot.
See [Catalog Architecture](docs/CATALOG_REFACTOR_PLAN.md) for the complete flow
and [Catalog Schema and Filters](docs/CATALOG_FILTERS.md) for the sidecar rules.
The exact published response is documented in
[Catalog Retriever capabilities](docs/API.md#catalog-retriever-get-capabilities).

## Get Started

### Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Version 20.10+ with Docker Compose plugin
- **Python**: Host Python for deployment helpers. From the cloned repo, install
  deploy-helper dependencies with:
  ```bash
  python -m pip install --user -r requirements-deploy.txt
  ```
- **NVIDIA NGC Account**: For API access ([Get API Key](https://ngc.nvidia.com/))
- **Hardware**: 4x H100 GPUs (preferred) or 4x A100 GPUs (minimum) for local deployment, or cloud access

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/retail-shopping-assistant.git
   cd retail-shopping-assistant
   ```

2. **Authenticate with NVIDIA Container Registry**:
   ```bash
   docker login nvcr.io
   ```
   Use `$oauthtoken` as the username and your NGC API key as the password.

3. **Install host deploy-helper dependencies**:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install --user -r requirements-deploy.txt
   ```

4. **Create and source an environment profile**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   $EDITOR .env
   source .env
   ```

   Set `NVIDIA_API_KEY` in the file. The env file is a sourceable shell file;
   sourcing it also sets `COMPOSE_DISABLE_ENV_FILE=1` so Docker Compose uses
   the exported shell environment instead of auto-parsing repo-root `.env`.

5. **Validate and deploy**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/model_config.py show --validate
   python scripts/model_config.py deploy --build
   ```

   The helper prints resolved endpoints without printing API keys. By default,
   `shared/configs/models.yaml` uses NVIDIA Build hosted endpoints for the
   app LLM, text embeddings, image embeddings, and guardrails, and starts no
   local NIM containers. The `vlm` role uses a hosted endpoint by default for
   image/video media understanding in addition to image embedding search; set it
   to `disabled` in `models.yaml` when that capability should be off.

   For local NIMs, edit the desired model roles in
   `shared/configs/models.yaml` to `source: local_nim`, then run:
   ```bash
   # Set LOCAL_NIM_CACHE in the sourced env profile first.
   mkdir -p "$LOCAL_NIM_CACHE" && chmod a+w "$LOCAL_NIM_CACHE"
   python scripts/model_config.py show --validate
   python scripts/model_config.py deploy --build
   ```

   Model routing lives in `shared/configs/models.yaml`.

6. **Access the application**: Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

7. **Stop the containers**:

   **Application services**:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml down
   ```

   **Local NIM services, if `models.yaml` started any**:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose-nim-local.yaml down
   ```

For detailed installation instructions, see [Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).
